# Work Log: Project Setup and Environment Configuration
**Date**: 2025-06-29
**Task**: Set up project structure and development environment

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Initialize UV Package Management
- Successfully initialized UV with `uv init --name iso-pulse-gen --app`
- Created basic `pyproject.toml` file with project metadata

### 2. Create Project Directory Structure
- Created organized directory structure:
  ```
  src/
  └── iso_pulse_gen/
      ├── audio/       # For audio generation modules
      └── gui/         # For GUI components
  tests/               # For test files
  ```
- Added `__init__.py` files to make directories proper Python packages

### 3. Configure Dependencies
- Updated `pyproject.toml` with core dependencies:
  - `numpy>=1.26.0` - For audio signal generation
  - `sounddevice>=0.4.6` - For real-time audio playback
  - `PySide6>=6.6.0` - For Qt-based GUI
- Added development dependencies:
  - `pytest>=7.4.0` - For testing
  - `black>=23.0.0` - For code formatting
  - `ruff>=0.1.0` - For linting

### 4. Create Initial Entry Point
- Updated `main.py` to initialize a PySide6 Qt application
- Created `src/iso_pulse_gen/gui/main_window.py` with a basic MainWindow class
- Application successfully starts and displays a placeholder window

### 5. Test Dependency Installation
- Ran `uv sync` successfully
- All 19 packages installed without errors
- Application runs without import errors

## Challenges Faced
- UV warned about skipping installation of entry points because the project is not packaged. This doesn't affect development but may need addressing for distribution.
- UV also warned about failed hardlinking due to different filesystems, but this doesn't impact functionality.

## Assumptions Made
- Used Python 3.12 as the base version (as detected by UV)
- Organized code into separate modules for audio and GUI components for better separation of concerns
- Created a placeholder GUI window to ensure the basic Qt application structure works

## Next Steps
Based on the implementation_tasks.md, the next high-priority tasks are:
1. Implement audio generation engine - Create sine wave carrier tone generator
2. Implement square wave modulation - Create on/off gating mechanism
3. Implement stereo channel support - Enable independent L/R channel generation

The project structure is now ready for implementing the core audio functionality.
